# üîóNarrow-Links

This project is an attempt to make a URL Shortener Service(Narrow-Links) - it creates a short, unique URL that will redirect to the specific website of the user's choice.
It is secure and has HTTP protocol and data encryption.
So if a person wants to shares a link or include a link in their profile there are circumstances where it is too long and it takes up the whole space and a lot of characters and which is a problem when there are limited characters to be typed. so our project solves the problem. we make those long URLs short and have a copy button to copy the short URL immediately.

It also has a QR Code Generator - which generates a QR code of the link pasted by the user and by scanning this URL it redirects to the Website link that the user pasted.

One more fature which is recently included is an easy one click button to send the link to whovever you want in the form of an SMS. **Twilio's SMS Api** is used to serve this purpose , you just have to enter the number and hit send , and the shortened link will reach to that number via SMS.
